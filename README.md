## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository showcases various cloud solution architecture projects we have developed for our clients and community. Each project is designed to be a learning resource and a template for building multi-cloud architectures.

### Directory Overview:
- **`docs/`**: Documentation on best practices, overviews, and future plans for both AWS-specific and multi-cloud architectures.
- **`aws/`**: Projects focused on AWS cloud architectures, including Terraform configurations and AWS CloudFormation templates.
- **`multi-cloud/`**: Projects that span multiple cloud providers, including Terraform, CloudFormation, Azure ARM templates, and GCP Deployment Manager configurations.
- **`.github/workflows/`**: Automated workflows for testing, deployment, and validation of cloud infrastructure code using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed on your local machine.
- **Terraform**: Used for infrastructure as code.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS services.
- **Azure CLI**: For managing Azure resources.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For managing GCP resources.

### Cloning the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-solution-architectures.git
cd cloud-solution-architectures
```

### Running Terraform:
1. Navigate to the desired project directory (e.g., `aws/project-1/`).
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. Validate and plan the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   terraform plan
   ```
4. Apply the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### Deploying with GitHub Actions:
- Review the workflow files in the `.github/workflows/` directory to understand the automation processes.
- Update the secrets in your GitHub repository to include your cloud credentials.
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment workflows.
